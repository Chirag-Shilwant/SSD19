<h2> What are Classes? </h2>
<p>Classes are the fundamental components of any object oriented design and development. Unless individual class, it's attributes and associated operations have been modeled well, a lot of suffereing could await during the development phase. However, unlike waterfall model, the life cycle in object oriented development is iterative. One builds a model, analyze it's efficiency, and refines it thereafter, if required. Therefore, an analyst, designer, or developer doesn't have the tight constraints to create a perfect art at one go.

</p>
</div>

<div class ="covidInfo1">
<h2> Description </h2>
<p> There are several diagram components which can be efficiently used while making/editing the model. These are as follows:
<ul>
<li>Class { name, attribute, method}</li>
<li>Objects</li>
<li>Interface</li>
<li>Relationships {inheritance, association, generalization}</li>
<li>Associations {bidirectional, unidirectional}</li>
</ul>
 </p>
</div>

<div class="covidInfo2">
<h2> Basic components of a class diagram</h2>
<p>

The standard class diagram is composed of three sections:
<br>
<ol>
<li>Upper section: Contains the name of the class. This section is always required, whether you are talking about the classifier or an object.</li><br>
<li>Middle section: Contains the attributes of the class. Use this section to describe the qualities of the class. This is only required when describing a specific instance of a class.</li><br>
<li>Bottom section: Includes class operations (methods). Displayed in list format, each operation takes up its own line. The operations describe how a class interacts with data.</li>
</ol>

</p>

<h2>Other Class Diagram Components</h2>

<ul>

<li>Name --> The first row in a class shape. </li><br>

<br><br>

<li>Attributes --> The second row in a class shape. Each attribute of the class is displayed on a separate line.</li><br>
<br>

<br><br>
<li>Methods --> The third row in a class shape. Also known as operations, methods are displayed in list format with each operation on its own line.</li><br>
<br>

<li>Inheritance/Generalization --> The process of a child or sub-class taking on the functionality of a parent or superclass, also known as generalization. It's symbolized with a straight connected line with a closed arrowhead pointing towards the superclass.</li>
<br>
<img src="./images/generalization.jpg" alt="Inheritence"> </img>
<br><br>
<li>Unidirectional association --> A slightly less common relationship between two classes. One class is aware of the other and interacts with it. Unidirectional association is modeled with a straight connecting line that points an open arrowhead from the knowing class to the known class.</li><br>
<li>Bidirectional association --> The default relationship between two classes. Both classes are aware of each other and their relationship with the other. This association is represented by a straight line between two classes.</li><br>

<li>Aggregation --> An aggregation is a special case of an association (see above) meaning “consists of”:<br>
The diamond documents this meaning; a caption is unnecessary.
